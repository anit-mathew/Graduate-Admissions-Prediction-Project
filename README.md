# Graduate Admissions Prediction Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Graduate Admissions Prediction project! In this project, we explore the factors influencing student admissions to master's degree programs. The dataset, inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset, includes parameters such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation strength, undergraduate GPA, research experience, and the chance of admission.

# Objectives:
- **Mean Admission Chance:** Explore if the mean chance of admission is greater than 60%.
- **Feature Correlation:** Examine the correlation between different features.
- **Predictive Factors:** Identify the most important factors in predicting admission chances.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Construct and optimize models for predicting admission chances and GRE scores.

# Methodology:
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing irrelevant columns and checking for missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Utilizing histograms and q-q plots to understand data distributions.
- **Statistical Tests:** Conducting a one-sample t-test for admission chances.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Using a correlation matrix to evaluate feature relationships.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing Random Forest Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.

#Results:
- **Data Validation:** Ensuring data integrity and normality for key variables.
- **Predictive Models:** Assessing the performance of Random Forest Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.
